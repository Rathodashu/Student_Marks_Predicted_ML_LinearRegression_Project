### How many hours need to do the study to get 99% marks?
### How many hours need to do the study to pass the exam?
### If I study X (e.g., 4) hours per day, how much marks will I get?

Designed a predictive model to address specific educational insights, answering key questions like hours needed for top scores, passing thresholds, and expected marks for various study times.

Built a Student Marks Predictor using Linear Regression, capable of predicting required study hours to achieve targeted academic goals, including high scores or passing grades.

Provided actionable insights for students on optimizing study hours, demonstrating the direct impact of study time on performance outcomes.
Created a versatile tool for academic planning that can estimate expected marks based on different study durations, enabling students to set realistic and achievable academic targets.

Utilized real-world business problem framing for a machine learning model, transforming educational data into valuable predictions for student success strategies.
